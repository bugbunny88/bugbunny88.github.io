                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>I'm a QA Engineer with a passion for problem-solving and delivering high-quality user experiences.
                    After transitioning from running my own business, I've thrived in fast-paced, dynamic environments,
                    where my background in leadership and a natural curiosity for improving processes have been
                    incredibly valuable in my role.</p>
                <p>I’m always looking for ways to grow—whether it's through meetups, conferences, or improving my
                    technical
                    skills. I enjoy staying updated on industry advancements and building connections in the QA
                    community.
                </p>
                <p>Outside of work, you’ll find me spending quality time with my family, baking sourdough bread, and
                    focusing on personal growth through meditation and journaling.</p>
