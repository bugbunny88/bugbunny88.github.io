                    <p>I'm a QA Engineer with a passion for problem-solving and delivering high-quality user
                        experiences.
                        After transitioning from running my own business, I've thrived in fast-paced, dynamic
                        environments,
                        where my background in leadership and a natural curiosity for improving processes have
                        been
                        incredibly
                        valuable in my role.</p>
                    <p>I’m always looking for ways to grow—whether it's through meetups, conferences, or improving my
                        technical skills. I enjoy staying updated on industry advancements and building connections in
                        the QA community.
                    </p>
                    <p>Outside of work, you’ll find me spending quality time with my family, baking sourdough
                        bread, and
                        focusing on personal growth through meditation and journaling.</p>
